Sistema Automatizado de Gestión de Estacionamientos

This project is part of Universidad Simón Bolívar's CI3715 software engineering course. It's a CRUD and management application for Parking vehicles in multiple parking lots.

Initially authored in November, 2014. This project is discontinued and I won't provide support for building the app, given how old and messy it grew in its time. Left as is, use as you wish (MIT Licensed).
